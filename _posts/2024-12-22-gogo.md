## Description

> Hmmm this is a weird file... enter_password. There is a instance of the service running at `mercury.picoctf.net:4052`.

This is a CTF challenge in the picoGym. The challenge is rated as Hard and is a reverse engineering challenge.

## Walkthrough

I start my investigation about "what the binary is doing" by running a simple `strings` on it.

There are quite many strings and other printable data in the binary which is a good sign, because it may include debugging information. Particularly interesting are the `fmt.` strings which indicate that this is probably a Go binary as the name already hints. I next loaded the binary into Ghidra and started by inspecting the `main.main` function.

I inspected the first view strings which are printed with the `Printf` function and they matched the strings which are printed if I execute the program:

So if we look closer to the code and get a high-level understanding of what it is doing, we can conclude that the binary is used to input a password and then apparently the function checkPassword is executed. The decompiled call to the function `main.checkPassword` looks quite broken in the Ghidra decompiler, but let's ignore this for a moment. The only thing to remember is that the function is called with an argument. Th next thing to do is inspecting the `main.checkPassword` function:

The code looks quite destroyed , this is a common problem in reverse engineering, you simply can't recover the code 1:1 you need to make assumptions and think about what the reason for the destroyed code could be.For example in this code the variables `local_40` to `local_24` clearly represent a string, you can see that because of the hex numbers which are numbers and characters. So let's highlight the key-points of what that code is doing:

- The first part assigns variables.
- The first `while` loop I simply ignored because it is common for Ghidra to add useless code and this looks like some memory checking code.
- The `if` checks probably if the length of the input is right in size, `0x20` or `32`.
- The next part assigns the string data from these hex numbers.
- `while (true)` XORs the input `data` with the string created from the hex numbers. This XORed data is then compared with the `local_20`, so this probably is the solution for finding the key. If the key matches the XORed data it continues and increases the counter.

Let's continue, the next question I asked myself is: Where is the `local_20` assigned and what is in this part of the stack while execution?

Before I start answering these questions I loaded the binary in IDA. It is always good to have a different decompiler running because each decompiler has advantages and disadvantages.

The IDA code looks much better: We see that we have a string which is copied, then XORed and compared. At this point I go curious what the string could be and simply googled it, it looks like a MD5 or so.

Ok, apparently this hash is reversed `goldfish`. I now checked this as a password. I doesn't work, but let's keep this in mind.

The next thing I did is starting the binary in `pwndbg` so we can step through the binary and check the different actions taken by the binary.

With some back checking in IDA I searched for a sweet point to debug the program.

The XOR in line `+166` looks pretty promising. There are two variables from a memory address XORed. After that the result is stored in `eax` adn `ebx`, with the operator `xchg` now the bytes in `eax` and `ebx` are compared with `cmp    al, bl`, which is the compare with the `local_20` from Ghidra.
I set a breakpoint at this address `0x80d4b2d` which is `+173`. I did that because `pwndbg` makes it in contrast to `gdb` very easy to see the next instructions and the results.

The first run looks good, in the first round of the loop we XOR `0x41` which is the first of my 32 inputed `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`'s with `0x38` which is the first hex number from the string we found in Ghidra. The result `121` or `0x79` is now subtracted from `0x4a` which is likely the first character of the string `local_20`. So if we make a small draft what we need we come to this equation:
```
hash_character XOR input_character = secret_string (aka local_20)
```

So to get our input character we just need to XOR the secret string character with the hash character. I now XORed the `0x38` with the `0x4a` this gave me `114` which is a `r` in ASCII.

**Note:** `python` is extremely helpful when solving these challenges, you can use `chr(number)` and `ord("c")` to convert characters to numbers and numbers to characters.

Now I restarted the binary with `run` in `pwndbg`. This time I added modified the first character to a `r` as the password.

The comparison now equals 0 which is excellent. So the first character is right, I continued the execution with `c` and then inspected the new equation.

This time we need to XOR `0x38` with `0x4a` which is an `e` in ASCII, you can use this command in Python `chr(0x36^0x53)`.
I now started the binary again and checked the second character and it worked, so the password starts with `re`. With that information I repeated the process 30 times (You probably can run the code one time and get all characters, but I'd like to check if they really work or if I made a mistake).

Note: I modified the breakpoint during that process to `0x80d4b26` because all of a sudden `pwndbg` decided to not output the numbers anymore...

After about 10 minutes I came to this password (I removed some characters): `reversAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAforward`. If we now run the program, we should get further.

Now they are asking for another key, weird, I just now tried the `goldfish` password because this is probably the solution.

![](/assets/blog/gogo/suc2.png)

Perfect the program now tries to open the `flag.txt` file, this means we successfully found out the password and can connect to the server and get the flag.

I encourage you doing the challenge you self and get familiar with tools like `pwndbg`. In addition to that feel free to scroll through the binary, you can now really reverse engineer more because you now know what the binary does.

## Conclusion

I really like the challenge because it encouraged me to use debugging to solve a reverse engineering challenge.
